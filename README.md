## React Employee Tracker

![example](/image/Capture.PNG)

## Desciption
This application is using an API to get 200 random users and then displays them. The table of employees can be searched through or sorted by alphabetical first name.

## Usage
The purpose of this application is to list all your employees and show their information and search through the list.

This application like previously state shows a list of 200 random users generated by an API. You can then sort them by alphabetical order of their first name. Another way is a search bar that allows you to look up a name and shows you in real time what employees have that name. In the same search bar, there is a suggested employee based on what you typed.
